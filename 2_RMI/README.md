### **Steps to Run:**

1. **Install the Pyro4 library:**
   Install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install Pyro4
   ```

2. **Run the Pyro Nameserver:**
   Use the following command to start the Pyro nameserver:
   ```bash
   Pyro4-ns
   ```

3. **Save the server and client code in separate files:**
   - Save the server code in a file called `server.py`.
   - Save the client code in a file called `client.py`.

4. **Start the Server:**
   Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where your `server.py` file is saved, and run the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

   You will see the server URI printed, which will also be saved to a file named `server_uri.txt`.

5. **Start the Client:**
   Open another terminal, navigate to the same directory, and run the client:
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

6. **Enter the Values for Concatenation:**
   Enter the two strings you want to concatenate when prompted by the client.

This example demonstrates a basic setup for using Pyro4 to create a distributed application for string concatenation.
